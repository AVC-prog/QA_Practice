There are 4 main folders, each of them containing an amalgamation of projects and problem sets in the respective areas.

It's important to note that this repository is constantly evolving, meaning that some of the content currently available consists of prototypes rather than final versions, as certain elements still need refinement.

For the postman practice project I followed freecodecamp's tutorial and I used this repository as guidance: https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md
