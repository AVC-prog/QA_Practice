There are 4 main folders, each of them containing an amalgamation of projects and problem sets in the respective areas.

It's important to note that this repository is constantly evolving, meaning that some of the content currently available consists of prototypes rather than final versions, as certain elements still need refinement.

I believe that the most effective way to improve is through trial and error. You may very well come across mistakes or imperfect solutions in the code, and I've purposely left them visible as a way to hold myself accountable.

For the postman practice project I followed freecodecamp's tutorial and I used this repository as guidance: https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md
