There are 4 main folders, each of them containing an amalgamation of projects and problem sets in the respective areas.

It's important to note that this repository is an ever-evolving one, in the sense that what is available now is a prototype and not the final versions, as some things still need honing.

For the postman practice project I followed freecodecamp's tutorial and I used this repository as guidance: https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md
